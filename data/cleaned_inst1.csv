3906	toward the left hand wall of the room	864.0
3907	you should be closer to that wall than she 	864.0
3908	and then once you are directly in alignment with her	864.0
3909	and two yards in front of her	864.0
3910	move a few paces to your right and stop 	864.0
3911	 mok i want you to turn around 	865.0
3912	and move in akis direction	865.0
3913	observe that you are on a more or less along the same straight line	865.0
3914	now get to the mid point of that line	865.0
3915	the line between where you are now	865.0
3916	and where she is now and then stop	865.0
3917	so toward aki get to the point midway between where she is now	866.0
3918	and where you are now	866.0
3919	 mok i want you to face the rear wall of the room 	866.0
3920	 move toward it a few paces	866.0
3921	maybe a foot and a half or so 	866.0
3922	 make sharp turn right 	866.0
3923	 come in akis direction	866.0
3924	get into alignment into direct alignment with aki 	866.0
3925	and then move a few paces back	866.0
3926	 so again turn around and face the rear wall 	867.0
3927	 move toward it about a foot and a half 	867.0
3928	and then make a sharp turn right 	867.0
3929	and get to move in akis direction and stop	867.0
3930	when you are in perfect alignment with her	867.0
3931	and then move a few paces back 	867.0
3932	 mok again i want you to do more or less what you did the last time	868.0
3933	i want you to do exactly as you did the last time	868.0
3934	back about a foot and a half from where you are toward the rear wall of the room 	868.0
3935	sharp turn right that would be toward aki	868.0
3936	and get yourself in perfect alignment with aki	868.0
3937	and then move a few paces back	868.0
3938	so back about a foot and a half toward the rear wall of the room	869.0
3939	sharp turn toward aki	869.0
3940	 get yourself in perfect alignment with aki 	869.0
3941	move a few paces back thank you 	869.0
3942	 mok i want you to move toward aki along the straight line	870.0
3943	between you and aki and stop midway	870.0
3944	between where you are now and where she is now 	870.0
3945	 so turn toward aki 	871.0
3946	 and move along the straight line between yourself and aki	871.0
3947	stop halfway between where you are now and where she is thank you 	871.0
3948	 mok again a few paces toward the rear wall of the room	872.0

3969	and then step a few paces back thank you 	874.0
3971	 mok i want you to move toward aki	875.0
3972	stop midway between the point where you are now	875.0
3973	and where she is positioned 	875.0
3974	 ok so move toward aki	875.0
3975	stop at the point midway between where you find yourself now	875.0
3976	and where she is positioned 	875.0
3977	 mok i want you to turn around 	876.0
3978	 and move along a diagonal	876.0
3979	so that you find yourself in front of aki	876.0
3980	and about two yards away from her	876.0
3981	she should be closer to the rear wall of the room	876.0
3982	when you are two yards in front of her perfectly aligned with her 	876.0
3983	and then step a few paces to your left and stop thank you 	876.0
3985	mok again i want you to move toward aki in a straight line	877.0
3986	and stop midway between the point where you are now and where she is now 	877.0
3987	 so turn and face aki 	877.0
3988	 and move toward her along the same straight line	877.0
3989	where you both are now and stop midway between the point	877.0
3990	where she is and you are now when you start off 	877.0
3991	 mok i want you to turn around and face the rear wall of the room 	878.0
